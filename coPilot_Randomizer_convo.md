**Me:**

> I'm working on a way to encrypt data similar to a book code. The book in my situation is a 10k file parsed as base64. Then, each letter in my message is found in the base64 output of the randomly generated 10k file, returning a number for the line the character is found in and a number for the position on the line where that character is found. Information is thus encoded in the string of digits, which can be deciphered from the same 10k file.

**Copilot:**

> That sounds like an interesting approach to encryption! Using a base64-encoded file as a reference for encoding and decoding messages is a creative twist on the traditional book cipher method. Here are a few thoughts and tips that might help you refine your method:
>
> 1. **Random File Generation**: Ensure that the 10k file is truly random and unique for each encryption session. This will enhance the security of your encryption method.
>
> 2. **Base64 Parsing**: Since base64 encoding can include characters like `+`, `/`, and `=`, make sure your parsing method can handle these characters appropriately.
>
> 3. **Character Mapping**: When mapping each character in your message to its position in the base64-encoded file, consider how you will handle cases where a character appears multiple times. You might want to use the first occurrence or a random occurrence to add an extra layer of complexity.
>
> 4. **Line and Position Encoding**: Encoding the line number and position within the line as a pair of digits is a good idea. Ensure that your format for these pairs is consistent and can be easily parsed during decryption.
>
> 5. **Security Considerations**: Think about how you will securely share the 10k file with the recipient. The security of your method relies heavily on the secrecy of this file.
>
> 6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage cases where a character in the message cannot be found in the base64-encoded file.

**Me:**

> So, I've considered these. I was thinking of having the 10k file by creating a random file in Python using a seed. That seed can be generated from combination of things like weather or stock data, the combination of which is known on both ends of the transaction, the encoder and decoder. Then that seed is refreshed every 30 or 60 seconds. I think that as long as the two ends of the transaction get the data at the same time then they will get the same seed from the combination of data. What are the potential security flaws in this approach, as well as the calculated leve of entropy and strengths of this approach.

**Copilot:**

> Your approach to generating a seed from a combination of weather or stock data is creative, but there are some potential security flaws and considerations regarding entropy:
>
> ### Potential Security Flaws
>
> 1. **Predictability**: Weather and stock data are not truly random and can be predicted or accessed by attackers. If an attacker can predict or access the same data sources, they can potentially generate the same seed and decrypt your messages[1](https://vault12.com/learn/cryptocurrency-security-how-to/crypto-cloud-storage/general-risks-for-handling-seed-phrases-on-computers).
>
> 2. **Synchronization Issues**: Ensuring both ends of the transaction receive the data at the exact same time can be challenging. Any delay or discrepancy in data retrieval could result in different seeds being generated, leading to decryption failures.
>
> 3. **Data Manipulation**: If the data sources (weather or stock data) are manipulated or tampered with, it could affect the seed generation process, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
>
> 4. **Backdoors**: Using publicly accessible data increases the risk of backdoors or intentional flaws being exploited by attackers[2](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-nsa-may-have-put-a-backdoor-in-rsas-cryptography-a-technical-primer/).
>
> ### Entropy Considerations
>
> 1. **Entropy Level**: The entropy of your seed depends on the randomness and unpredictability of the data sources. Weather and stock data have limited entropy compared to truly random sources. This could make your encryption less secure[3](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/cryptography/entropy-calculations/).
>
> 2. **Shannon Entropy**: Calculating the Shannon entropy of your seed can help determine its randomness. Higher entropy indicates better security. However, publicly available data typically has lower entropy compared to cryptographic random number generators[3](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/cryptography/entropy-calculations/).
>
> ### Strengths
>
> 1. **Ease of Implementation**: Using publicly available data sources simplifies the seed generation process and ensures both parties can access the same data without needing a secure channel to share the seed.
>
> 2. **Dynamic Seed Generation**: Refreshing the seed every 30 or 60 seconds adds a layer of security by limiting the time window an attacker has to predict or access the seed.
>
> ### Recommendations
>
> 1. **Enhance Randomness**: Consider combining multiple sources of entropy, including hardware-based random number generators, to improve the randomness of your seed.
>
> 2. **Secure Data Channels**: Ensure that the data used for seed generation is transmitted securely and is not susceptible to tampering or interception.
>
> 3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and audit your seed generation process to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
>
> Would you like more detailed advice on any specific part of your encryption method or further assistance with implementing these recommendations?

**Me:**

> I'm trying to create a system of encryption that is secure regardless of TLS SSL, or other methods. This as a means of allowing security even when these traditional methods are compromised or insufficient.

**Copilot:**

> Creating an encryption system that operates independently of TLS/SSL is a challenging but worthwhile endeavor. Here are some key considerations and potential approaches to ensure robust security:
>
> ### Key Considerations
>
> 1. **True Randomness**: Ensure that your seed generation process uses truly random data sources. Combining multiple entropy sources, including hardware-based random number generators, can enhance security.
>
> 2. **Synchronization**: Implement a reliable method for both parties to synchronize their seed generation. This could involve using a secure time server or a shared secret that is updated periodically.
>
> 3. **Data Integrity**: Use cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure the integrity of the data being encrypted and decrypted. This helps detect any tampering or corruption.
>
> 4. **Key Management**: Develop a secure key management system to handle encryption keys. This includes secure key storage, distribution, and rotation.
>
> ### Potential Approaches
>
> 1. **One-Time Pad (OTP)**: A theoretically unbreakable encryption method if the key is truly random, as long as the key is as long as the message and used only once. However, key distribution and management can be challenging.
>
> 2. **Symmetric Encryption**: Use algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting data. Ensure that the keys are securely generated and exchanged.
>
> 3. **Asymmetric Encryption**: Use public-key cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC) for secure key exchange. This can be combined with symmetric encryption for data encryption.
>
> 4. **Hybrid Encryption**: Combine symmetric and asymmetric encryption to leverage the strengths of both. For example, use asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a symmetric key, which is then used for data encryption.
>
> ### Example Implementation
>
> Here's a simplified example of how you might implement a hybrid encryption system in Python:
>
> ```python
> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
> from Crypto.Cipher import AES, PKCS1_OAEP
> import os
> 
> # Generate RSA keys
> key = RSA.generate(2048)
> private_key = key.export_key()
> public_key = key.publickey().export_key()
> 
> # Encrypt a message using AES
> def encrypt_message(message, public_key):
>     # Generate a random AES key
>     aes_key = os.urandom(32)
>     cipher_aes = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_EAX)
>     ciphertext, tag = cipher_aes.encrypt_and_digest(message.encode('utf-8'))
> 
>     # Encrypt the AES key with the RSA public key
>     cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(RSA.import_key(public_key))
>     encrypted_aes_key = cipher_rsa.encrypt(aes_key)
> 
>     return encrypted_aes_key, cipher_aes.nonce, tag, ciphertext
> 
> # Decrypt a message using AES
> def decrypt_message(encrypted_aes_key, nonce, tag, ciphertext, private_key):
>     # Decrypt the AES key with the RSA private key
>     cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(RSA.import_key(private_key))
>     aes_key = cipher_rsa.decrypt(encrypted_aes_key)
> 
>     # Decrypt the message with the AES key
>     cipher_aes = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce=nonce)
>     message = cipher_aes.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
> 
>     return message.decode('utf-8')
> 
> # Example usage
> message = "This is a secret message."
> encrypted_aes_key, nonce, tag, ciphertext = encrypt_message(message, public_key)
> decrypted_message = decrypt_message(encrypted_aes_key, nonce, tag, ciphertext, private_key)
> 
> print("Original message:", message)
> print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)

> This example demonstrates a hybrid encryption approach where an AES key is used to encrypt the message, and the AES key itself is encrypted using RSA. This ensures that even if the symmetric key is compromised, the data remains secure due to the RSA encryption.

**Me:**

< I need a way for the same seed to be generated on both ends independantly of each other, which is why a combination of publicly available data is necessary. Are there truely random, but publically available data sources that may work for somehthing like this? Note that even if publicly available, the seed can be generated with a combination of this data where the algorithm of combination is not made public. The periodic regeneration of the seed in 30, 60, or some other period should also add to the complexity of an atacker recreating the seed.

**Copilot:**

> Using publicly available data to generate a seed is a clever approach, but finding truly random sources can be challenging. Here are a few potential sources of publicly verifiable randomness that might work for your encryption system:
>
> ### Potential Sources of Publicly Available Randomness
>
> 1. **Pulsars**: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. The timing of these pulses is highly regular but can exhibit random variations. Researchers have proposed using pulsars as a source of publicly verifiable randomness[1](https://astrobites.org/2022/03/03/pulsars-the-key-to-secure-encryption/). Since pulsars can be observed from different locations on Earth, they provide a unique and unpredictable source of randomness.
>
> 2. **Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs)**: Some organizations provide access to quantum random number generators, which use quantum phenomena to generate truly random numbers. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed methods to generate and certify quantum random numbers[2](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/04/nists-new-quantum-method-generates-really-random-numbers). These numbers can be accessed publicly and used as a source of randomness.
>
> 3. **Atmospheric Noise**: Atmospheric noise, such as variations in electromagnetic signals caused by lightning strikes and cosmic rays, can be used to generate random numbers. Websites like random.org provide random numbers generated from atmospheric noise[3](https://bluegoatcyber.com/blog/exploring-true-randomness-in-cryptography-and-security/).
>
> ### Combining Data Sources
>
> To enhance security, you can combine multiple sources of randomness. For example, you could use a combination of pulsar timings, quantum random numbers, and atmospheric noise. By applying a proprietary algorithm to combine these sources, you can generate a seed that is difficult for attackers to predict or reproduce.
>
> ### Periodic Regeneration
>
> Refreshing the seed periodically (e.g., every 30 or 60 seconds) adds another layer of complexity. Ensure that both parties synchronize their clocks accurately to generate the same seed at the same time. Using a secure time server or a shared secret can help achieve this synchronization.
>
> ### Example Approach
>
> Here's a conceptual example of how you might combine these sources in Python:
>
> ```python
> import requests
> import hashlib
> import time
> 
> def get_pulsar_randomness():
>     # Example function to fetch pulsar data (replace with actual data source)
>     return "pulsar_data"
> 
> def get_quantum_randomness():
>     # Example function to fetch quantum random numbers (replace with actual data source)
>     response = requests.get("https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/jsonI.php?length=1&type=uint8")
>     return response.json()['data'][0]
> 
> def get_atmospheric_randomness():
>     # Example function to fetch atmospheric noise data (replace with actual data source)
>     response = requests.get("https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=1&format=h")
>     return response.text
> 
> def generate_seed():
>     pulsar_data = get_pulsar_randomness()
>     quantum_data = get_quantum_randomness()
>     atmospheric_data = get_atmospheric_randomness()
>     
>     combined_data = f"{pulsar_data}{quantum_data}{atmospheric_data}"
>     seed = hashlib.sha256(combined_data.encode()).hexdigest()
>     return seed
> 
> # Generate a new seed every 60 seconds
> while True:
>     seed = generate_seed()
>     print(f"Generated seed: {seed}")
>     time.sleep(60)
> ```
>
> This example demonstrates how to fetch data from different sources and combine them to generate a seed. You can replace the placeholder functions with actual data retrieval methods and customize the combination algorithm to suit your needs.
